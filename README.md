# Black-Friday-Sales-Prediction
In this project the machine learning models, i.e. the linear regression model 
and gradient boosting algorithm is used to predict the amount spent by 
the customer on Black Friday.
Linear regression represents a very simple method for supervised learning 
and it is an effective tool for predicting quantitative responses. 
Gradient boosting is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, 
which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees.
